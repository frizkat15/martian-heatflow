The files in this Zenodo repository were compiled by Katelyn Frizzell in June 2023 for the manuscript "Bounding the unknowns of Martian crustal heat flow from a synthesis of regional geochemistry and Insight mission data", submitted to Icarus.

Data:
__________

The data file consists of major datasets that were used to create the heat flow models, including:

Tc_density_maps:
	The generated crustal thickness/density maps from Wieczorek et al., 2022 paper

GRS_maps:
	GRS files from the Rani et al., 2022 work, which are also available on LSU's digital commons: (https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/geo_psl/1/)

MOLA_background:
___________

This file includes the MOLA hillshade used for the background in some of the figures

Project_Code:
___________

This file consists of the code used to generate model results and figures, in matlab and jupyter notebooks (python)

--

Results:
___________

This file has two sub-files: Modern_Day_HF and Noachian_HF and contain model results (exponential decrease, linear decrease, constant/homogeneous, and exponential increase) for each scenario as matlab files. The Noachian subfolder also includes some files with different Th/U ratios. Data is plotted in 5deg x 5deg bins and centered around a latitude of 180 degrees.
